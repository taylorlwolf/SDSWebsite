# Using Python and R Together

In this post, I will demonstrate the ways in which Python and R can be used communicate with each other. More specifically, I will take you on a journey to an alternate dimension in which people speak their thoughts aloud.

Do you ever wish that you could hear other peoples' thoughts? Whether you are on a first date or interviewing for a job, at times it would prove useful to know what another person is thinking. Using the Reticulate package, this dream can become a reality! In this example, the R text is what you are saying audibly, while Python contains your innermost thoughts.

Suppose you run into an old "frenemy" while out for a brisk walk. This is what you are probably saying out loud...
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
speech<- "I love your dress!"
speech2<- "Where did you get it?"
speech3<- "And your dog is just the cutest!"

#You say...
speech
speech2
speech3
```

Despite the outwardly friendly appearance, this is probably what you're truly thinking to yourself...
```{python}
#Python code chunk
thought="(lowkey it's hideous!)"
thought2="(from your grandmother's closet?)"
thought3="(he looks like a drowned rat.)"

#You're really thinking...
print(thought)
print(thought2)
print(thought3)
```

Using Reticulate, you can say your thoughts out loud!
```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(speech,py$thought))
cat(c(speech2,py$thought2))
cat(c(speech3,py$thought3))
```

Now, aren't you glad that people cannot hear your thoughts?
