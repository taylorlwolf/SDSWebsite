# Using Python and R Together

In this blog post, I will demonstrate the ways in which Python and R can be used communicate with each other. 

Ever wish that you could hear other peoples' thoughts, though? Using the Reticulate package, you can! In this case, the R text is what you are saying audibly, and Python contains your innermost thoughts.

So, this is what you are probably saying out loud...
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
speech<- "I love your dress!"
speech2<- "Where did you get it?"
speech3<- "And your dog is just the cutest!"
```

And this is probably what you're thinking to yourself...
```{python}
#Python code chunk
thought="(lowkey it's hideous!)"
print(thought)
thought2="(from your grandmother's closet?)"
thought3="(he looks like a drowned rat.)"
```

Using Reticulate, you can say your thoughts out loud!
```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(speech,py$thought))
cat(c(speech2,py$thought2))
cat(c(speech3,py$thought3))
```

Now, aren't you glad that people cannot hear your thoughts?
