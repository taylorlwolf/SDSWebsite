<h1>Using Python and R Together</h1>
<p>In this blog post, I will demonstrate the ways in which Python and R can be used communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Ever wish that you could hear other peoples’ thoughts, though? Using the Reticulate package, you can! In this case, the R text is what you are saying audibly, and Python contains your innermost thoughts.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/pythonpost_files/thoughts.png" /></p>
<p>So, this is what you are probably saying out loud…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
speech&lt;- &quot;I love your dress!&quot;
speech2&lt;- &quot;Where did you get it?&quot;
speech3&lt;- &quot;And your dog is just the cutest!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And this is probably what you’re thinking to yourself…</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk
thought=&quot;(lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)&quot;
print(thought)
## (lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)
thought2=&quot;(from your grandmother&#39;s closet?)&quot;
thought3=&quot;(he looks like a drowned rat.)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Using Reticulate, you can say your thoughts out loud!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
cat(c(speech,py$thought))
## I love your dress! (lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)
cat(c(speech2,py$thought2))
## Where did you get it? (from your grandmother&#39;s closet?)
cat(c(speech3,py$thought3))
## And your dog is just the cutest! (he looks like a drowned rat.)</code></pre>
<p>Now, aren’t you glad that people cannot hear your thoughts?</p>
