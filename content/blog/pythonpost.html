<h1>Using Python and R Together</h1>
<p>In this post, I will demonstrate the ways in which Python and R can be used communicate with each other. More specifically, I will take you on a journey to an alternate dimension in which people speak their thoughts aloud.</p>
<p>Do you ever wish that you could hear other peoples’ thoughts? Whether you are on a first date or interviewing for a job, at times it would prove useful to know what another person is thinking. Using the Reticulate package, this dream can become a reality! In this example, the R text is what you are saying audibly, while Python contains your innermost thoughts.</p>

<p>Suppose you run into an old “frenemy” while out for a brisk walk. This is what you are probably saying out loud…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
speech&lt;- &quot;I love your dress!&quot;
speech2&lt;- &quot;Where did you get it?&quot;
speech3&lt;- &quot;And your dog is just the cutest!&quot;

#You say...
speech
## [1] &quot;I love your dress!&quot;
speech2
## [1] &quot;Where did you get it?&quot;
speech3
## [1] &quot;And your dog is just the cutest!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Despite the outwardly friendly appearance, this is probably what you’re truly thinking to yourself…</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk
thought=&quot;(lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)&quot;
thought2=&quot;(from your grandmother&#39;s closet?)&quot;
thought3=&quot;(he looks like a drowned rat.)&quot;

#You&#39;re really thinking...
print(thought)
## (lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)
print(thought2)
## (from your grandmother&#39;s closet?)
print(thought3)
## (he looks like a drowned rat.)</code></pre>
<p>Using Reticulate, you can say your thoughts out loud!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
cat(c(speech,py$thought))
## I love your dress! (lowkey it&#39;s hideous!)
cat(c(speech2,py$thought2))
## Where did you get it? (from your grandmother&#39;s closet?)
cat(c(speech3,py$thought3))
## And your dog is just the cutest! (he looks like a drowned rat.)</code></pre>
<p>I don’t know about you, but suddenly I’m very glad that others cannot hear my innermost thoughts.</p>
