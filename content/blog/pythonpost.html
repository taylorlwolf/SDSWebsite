<h1>Python</h1>
<p>In this blog post, I will demonstrate the ways in which Python and R can be used together. Specifically, this post will make you glad that people cannot hear your thoughts out loud. Ever wish that you could hear other peoplesâ€™ thoughts, though? Using the Reticulate package, you can!</p>

<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
speech&lt;- &quot;I love your dress&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk
thought=&quot;(lowkey it&#39;s hideous)!&quot;
print(r.speech,thought)
## I love your dress (lowkey it&#39;s hideous)!</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
cat(c(speech,py$thought))
## I love your dress (lowkey it&#39;s hideous)!</code></pre>
